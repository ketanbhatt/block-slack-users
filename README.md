<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/happy-slack-hide-messages/mjingehmnkofkklkdlipioiinepjghlo"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alrra/browser-logos/master/src/chrome/chrome_32x32.png" /></a>
Install Happy Slack! from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/happy-slack-hide-messages/mjingehmnkofkklkdlipioiinepjghlo).

## Features:
1. Hide messages from any User
2. Hide messages from any bot
3. Optionally allow messages to be hidden only from DMs

## How To Use:
1. Click on the extension icon or navigate to extension options.
2. Enter the `ID` of the user/bot you want to block. **NOTE:** This ID is not the slack handle the user/bot has, but the unique ID that slack assigns to every User/Bot. 
3. You can get the ID by **right clicking on the user's/bot's name/photo from any channel**, and **selecting `Inspect`**. From there, look for the property **`data-member-id` (if it is a user or slackbot) OR `data-bot-id` (if it is any other bot)**. That is the ID we are looking for.
4. You can block multiple users or bots by specifying their User IDs separated by `,`.
5. Make sure you want to make Slack a happy place again.
6. Save!
